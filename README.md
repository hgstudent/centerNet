# CenterNet
Minimal tf2.0 implementation of CenterNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08189)

#### Doing:
+ Center heatmap
+ Post-processing 

#### ToDo:
+ [ ] Implement data handing for easier training of model
+ [ ] Train on Kitti, kitti is currently bugged in Tensorflow datasets, will train when its fixed

### Done:
- [x] Top left and bottom right pooling
- [x] Push and pull loss
- [x] Base model architecture 


Note: Not planning to implement intermediate supversion until a late stage.
